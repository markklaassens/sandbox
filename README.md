# Sandbox Repository

Welcome to my sandbox repository, where you'll find various experiments, puzzles, and mini-games. This repository is a collection of small projects, primarily written in Java, where I explore different programming concepts, solve puzzles, and develop mini-games. Feel free to browse the code, experiment with it, and provide feedback.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`src/puzzles/`** Contains various puzzle-solving algorithms and challenges. Each class is designed to solve a specific puzzle or problem.
- **`src/games/`** This directory includes simple games and game-related algorithms. The games are basic but serve as good practice for game development and logic implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- A code editor or IDE that supports Java, such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).
