# Sandbox Repository

Welcome to my sandbox repository, where you'll find various experiments, puzzles, and mini-games. 
This repository is a collection of small projects, primarily written in Java, where I explore 
different programming concepts, solve puzzles, and develop mini-games. Feel free to browse the code, 
experiment with it, and provide feedback.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `src/puzzles/` Contains various puzzle-solving algorithms and challenges. 
- `src/games/` This directory includes simple games and game-related algorithms.
